    "who_i_am_text": "Born in Didiévi, Côte d'Ivoire, I discovered my passion for numbers and data early on. That journey took me from ENSEA Abidjan — one of Africa's premier statistics schools — to a Master's in Statistics & Econometrics at Université Toulouse I Capitole in France, and advanced programs at MIT. Over 13+ years, I've served 11 organizations across 6+ countries — from the United Nations system (ITU, IOM, UNHCR, UNIDIR) to the International Cocoa Organization and the African Export-Import Bank. Today, I combine deep expertise in AI, data science, statistics, and econometrics to drive data-driven transformation for international organizations and African development. I am driven by a singular belief: Africa's prosperity must be built by Africans, powered by data and intelligence.",

With over 13 years across 11 international organizations spanning the UN system, the International Cocoa Organization, development finance, and the private sector, I bridge the gap between rigorous quantitative analysis and practical, impactful solutions. From building enterprise AI systems and data architectures at Afreximbank to leading econometric analysis of global cocoa markets at ICCO, I bring a rare blend of technical depth and strategic vision to every engagement.",
